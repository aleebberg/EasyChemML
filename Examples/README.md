# Examples

A few examples to understand the handling of the framework.

* **CATBOOST_DOYLE**

Includes loading XLSX data, converting SMILES to MFF (Multi-Feature-Fingerprint), test-train splitting, model training, saving and reusing the learned model.

* **ECPF-TEST**

Includes loading from XLSX files, conversion from SMILES to ECFP, test-train splitting, model training and evaluation.

* **HYPERPARAMTER-TUNING**

Includes loading from XLSX files, conversion from SMILES to MFF, test-train splitting, model training with hyperparameter optimization (Hyperopt) and evaluation.

* **MFF_SAVELOAD_MODEL**

Simple example: Includes loading from XLSX files, conversion from SMILES to the MFF, test-train splitting, model training, model saving and evaluation.

* **MUTLISPLITTING**

Includes loading XLSX data, converting SMILES to MFF (multi-feature fingerprint), splitting test and training, training the model, saving and reusing the learned model. Its a large Example with different input files
